Beyond the built-in features, the Java codebase of Burp Suite.
facilitates the development of extensions to enhance the framework's functionality. 
These extensions can be written in Java, Python (using the Java Jython interpreter), or Ruby (using the Java JRuby interpreter).
The Burp Suite Extender module allows for quick and easy loading of extensions into the framework, while the marketplace, known as the BApp Store, 
enables downloading of third-party modules. While certain extensions may require a professional license for integration.
